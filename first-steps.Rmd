### Intimidated?

. . .

- Decades of history.

- Bazillion tutorials.

- _Opinionated_ views.

. . .

### But fear not!

. . .

- _Incremental use_ works.

- Learn a few steps. Master them.

- Learn some more.

### A really good \alert{builtin} resource

. . .

- The Emacs Tutorial
  - just hit `C-h t`
  - ie type `Ctrl` _and `h`_, then type `t`.
- Covers a lot of the basis
- Worth spending some time with
- And revisiting

## Emacs: Editing

### Key Advantages

. . .

- Particular uses _carry from one mode to another_ for (essentially)
  all forms of text

- There are too many to enumerate but ...

- ... (maybe my) favourite example

  - `C-space` to mark a starting
  - Navigate to end
  - `M-x comment-region` will uncomment the regions
  - In \alert{any programming language} or \alert{text format}

- Also cool:  Prefix the same with `C-u` ("undo") to uncomment

## Emacs: Editing

### More Key Advantages (via Somewhat Random Personal Selection)

. . .

- Indentation is always sensitive to the programming language

- `M-q` formats ("flows") indents a paragraph

- `C-M-\` indents a region in the current language

- Very powerful 'undo' feature

- Rectangular regions (could be a five-mi presentation in itself)

- 'Record' key sequence to 'replay' for ad-hoc automation (ditto)

- Named Register to hold paste-able content or positions (ditto)
